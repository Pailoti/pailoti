Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently studying software analysis and development
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning Back-end Java in the DIO bootcamp program 
- ğŸ‘¯ I'm still not sure what area I want to pursue, but I'm very interested in cybersecurity.
- ğŸ¤” I am looking for help with java and python
